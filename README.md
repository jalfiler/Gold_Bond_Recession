# Business Problem - The Gold Plan

Our CEO, Georgia Alaska, is concerned about the possibility of a recession and wants to protect our shareholders by exploring a potential trading strategy involving gold. She read in the newspaper that an inverted yield curve is a signal for recession, and believes that holding gold during a recession is a wise move to mitigate risk. 

As a company that is sensitive to poor sales and performance during a recession, it is within our management's latitude to enter into risk mitigation strategies, including making financial investments unrelated to our core business. Georgia wants to know if we can come up with a financial trading strategy that predicts a recession and hedges against it by making trading profits to offset anticipated lower sales. 

To help inform our decision, we will analyze whether holding gold during an inverted yield curve signal is a viable trading strategy.
